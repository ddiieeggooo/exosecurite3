In this repo you have a voting system that can ba attacked by a gas limit DOS, because in the votes tallied function, the loop will reach proposals.lenght, and this length can be very high if the Attack contract would have been deployed against the voting system, to prevent this you can do two different things written in the VotingFixed contract, you can :
- find the winningproposalId directly in the vote function, the winningproposalId will be updated every time the vote function will be called, so it's not the best choice imo, because you will have to call for computation a lot of time
- you also can cap the proposals.lenght, it's subjective but you can chose a good cap from the beginning if you thing about what your project will be and how it will or can scale in term of users reach.
